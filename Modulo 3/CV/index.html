                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <h2>Experienced Senior Product Designer: User-Centered, Collaborative, Growth-Focused</h2>
                <p>Hi! I'm Ana, a senior product designer from Panama currently based in Argentina. I'm passionate about technology, photography, teaching, and, of course, design!</p>
                <p>My focus is on user-centered design and Lean UX, solving user needs while driving profitability for clients. I prioritize accessibility, usability, and inclusivity, ensuring our products are truly for everyone.</p>
                <p>In my design process, I start by immersing myself in user research, diving deep into understanding the needs, motivations, and pain points of the target audience. This helps me gain valuable insights to inform my design decisions. With a solid foundation of user understanding, I move on to sketching and wireframing, exploring various design concepts and information architectures. I then transform these wireframes into visually engaging prototypes, testing and iterating them to ensure a seamless user experience. Throughout the process, I collaborate closely with cross-functional teams, incorporating feedback and refining designs to deliver exceptional products that truly resonate with users.</p>
                <p>I emphasize good design etiquette within teams. I promote documentation, effective communication, and a culture of listening, constructive criticism, and collaboration. If you are a leader and have read and agree with Radical Candor, we are going to get along great. </p>
                <p>I thrive in companies that value a healthy work environment and prioritize employee well-being. I believe in continuous growth, supported by good HR practices and the provision of necessary tools. Mentorship, clear career paths, and real growth opportunities excite me!</p>
                <p>As a tech nerd, I'm always learning new tools and software. I constantly enhance my skills through self-learning, reading, and taking courses. Let's connect and create exceptional experiences together! I'm ready to contribute my expertise and passion as a senior product designer.</p>
